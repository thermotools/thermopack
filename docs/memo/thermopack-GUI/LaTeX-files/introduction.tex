\section{Introduction}

One tool for contributing to lower \ce{CO2} emissions is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. SINTEF has since 2011 developed a set of thermodynamic models, \textit{Thermopack}, to describe physical properties for \ce{CO2} mixtures. This is used to test, varify and compare both existing and new theoretical models. To make \textit{Thermopack} more accessible, the aim of this project has been to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI), where the user can interact with \textit{Thermopack} in an easier way.

To create this GUI, a Python plugin called PyQt5 was used. This is a Python bundle for Qt, which is a well documented, open-source tool for creating cross-platform GUIs. It comes with a designer tool, Qt Designer, which makes it easy and fast to design and create code.
