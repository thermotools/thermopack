## About

Thermopack is a thermodynamics library for multi-component and
multi-phase thermodynamics developed at [SINTEF Energy
Research](https://www.sintef.no/en/sintef-energy/) and [NTNU
Department of
Chemistry](https://www.ntnu.edu/chemistry/research/thermodynamics). Through
decades of research, we have developed a software that performs
thermodynamic calculations. A large selection of equations of state
has been implemented in this software. Most of these equations of
state have been developed by other research groups around the world,
but some of them have been developed by us. Thermopack has been a
much-appreciated in-house powerhouse.

Thermopack is available for everybody, free of charge under the
Apache 2.0 open-source licenses. Thermopack is written in FORTRAN
to handle heavy numerical computations associated with process and
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The thermodynamic
framework is easily interfaced from C/C++ and also contains a flexible
Python wrapper to make scripting easy.
