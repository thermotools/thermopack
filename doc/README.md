## Documentation

The directory `./memo` contains documentation of equations and numerics central to the Fortran-side of thermopack.

The directory `./markdown` contains various markdown files that are combined using the scripts in `../addon/pyUtils/docs` to generate wiki-files, the main README and the pypi-readme.
